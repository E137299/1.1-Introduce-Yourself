# 1.1-Introduce-Yourself

Notes:[ print()](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JSrOECf5FeozLVAlGu7IDqGoR6bf3mR1?usp=sharing)

Write a program that prints the following:
- your name
- your grade
- your programming experience
- reason for taking the class
- something that you want me to know about you.

Hereâ€™s an example of what your program could display:
```
My name is Eric Fritz.
I'm in 10th grade.
At Small Middle School, I learned a little Python, and I did a lot of web development.
I want to make games. 
My ADHD makes it difficult for me to focus sometimes, and I run cross country.
```
